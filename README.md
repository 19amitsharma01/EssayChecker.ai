services such as personalized feedback and performance analytics. Collaborating with the engineering team, I implemented a Flask Restful API, leveraging OpenAI and Large Language Models (LLM) to generate human-like feedback. By strategically employing prompts, embeddings, and fine-tuning techniques, I ensured the feedback's quality and coherence.

One significant achievement involves the development of a predictive tool within the API. This tool accurately forecasts marks for diverse content types, including essays, quizzes, and chatbots. Through meticulous calibration and testing, I fine-tuned the models to achieve reliable predictions, contributing to a more efficient evaluation process.

In tandem, I focused on elevating the user experience by introducing premium services. Users now benefit from personalized feedback tailored to their writing style and performance analytics that offer valuable insights for improvement. This initiative aimed not only to correct errors but to empower users with actionable suggestions, fostering a dynamic learning environment.

My internship at EssayChecker.ai has been a dynamic blend of data science and user experience enhancement. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies, I have contributed to the creation of a more sophisticated and user-centric platform, ensuring that users receive not just corrections but valuable insights to refine their writing skills. As I continue to explore the intersection of data science and user-focused solutions, this experience has been instrumental in honing my skills and making meaningful contributions to the field.
